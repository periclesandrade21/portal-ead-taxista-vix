The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack EAD platform for taxi drivers in Espírito Santo. The work progressed chronologically, starting with core features like a landing page, PIX payment integration, and a subscription system. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in UI/UX, iteratively refining the design with glassmorphism effects, relevant imagery, and a video integration. Key functionalities like an admin panel with user management and financial metrics, and an expanded student registration form were implemented. Crucially, the engineer also provisioned a comprehensive Terraform infrastructure for Oracle Cloud, integrating Moodle, Auth0, Docker, and a CI/CD pipeline. The work paused while addressing a complex request for an AI bot, password reset via email/SMS, and automated course unlocking upon PIX payment, and also clarifying Moodle password management.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a modern, customized EAD Moodle platform for taxi drivers in Espírito Santo, provisioned on Oracle Cloud via Docker.
Key features requested include:
1.  **Payment System**: PIX integration using QR code or phone number (initially), later changed to CNPJ (02.914.651/0001-12).
2.  **Platform Integration**: EAD portal to be added to .
3.  **Study Modules**: Creation of study modules with video upload capabilities, based on CONTRAN Resolution 456/2013 (Relações Humanas, Direção Defensiva, Primeiros Socorros, Mecânica Básica - total 28h) and optional modules (Inglês Básico Turismo, Turismo Local, Atendimento ao Cliente, Conhecimentos da Cidade). Modules should display themes and workload on hover.
4.  **Deployment**: Provisioning on Oracle Cloud with containerization.
5.  **Authentication**: Auth0 for single-device verification (mobile/personal computer).
6.  **Admin Panel**: To monitor student count, unlock devices, check values/payments, manual password reset, grant bonuses/discounts.
7.  **Exams**: 10-question exams per module with three difficulty levels.
8.  **Certificates**: Automatic certificates upon scoring >7 and completing all mandatory modules, recognized by DETRAN, cooperatives (later changed to Sindicato, Prefeituras, Governo do Estado/Federal), valid nationally, and with anti-falsification QR code.
9.  **Contact Info**: Specific WhatsApp, Email, Site, Phone, and physical address provided. Later updated with new phone, email, and physical address.
10. **AI Bot**: For WhatsApp Q&A, password reset (email/SMS), course doubts, values, and to state that course values will be disclosed soon.
11. **Subscription Form**: Add Placa do Carro and Alvará fields.
12. **Infrastructure**: Terraform for Oracle Cloud (VM, Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Auth0), CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
13. **UI/UX**: Modern, smooth design with glassmorphism, specific taxi images (including local ES taxi, then carousel), improved typography, and a historical ES landmark (Terceira Ponte) as a subtle watermark.

The engineer has implemented most of the UI/UX, PIX payment (CNPJ), basic subscription with new fields (Placa, Alvará), admin panel (login, metrics, user management), student/admin portals, Auth0 setup, initial Terraform for Oracle Cloud deployment, and a CI/CD pipeline. The AI bot and automated course liberation based on PIX payment are the current focus.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had finished setting up the comprehensive Terraform infrastructure for Oracle Cloud, including Docker Compose for the application components (FastAPI backend, React frontend, MongoDB, Nginx), Moodle LMS with PostgreSQL, and Auth0 integration. A CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions was also created to automate testing and deployment from the user's GitHub repository ().

The AI engineer attempted to push the newly created  directory content to the user's GitHub repository but encountered errors due to existing  and  files at the root (). The script () also failed because it was executed from the wrong directory.

The user then provided a new set of requirements:
1.  Add an AI bot to answer questions, handle password resets (email/SMS), and answer course/value queries. The bot should state that values will be disclosed soon.
2.  Implement a feature to automatically unlock courses upon PIX payment.
3.  Ask where users will register/set their password for Moodle.

The AI engineer acknowledged these requests and indicated a plan to use the  for the AI bot and create a system for automatic PIX verification. The conversation ended with the AI engineer asking for clarification on the AI bot's specific functionalities.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the AI bot functionalities as requested, focusing on password reset, Q&A, and automatic course unlocking upon PIX payment, and address the Moodle password question.
