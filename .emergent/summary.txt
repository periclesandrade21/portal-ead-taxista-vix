The AI engineer has focused on iteratively building and refining a comprehensive EAD platform for taxi drivers. Initial efforts established core features like user registration, PIX payments, and an admin panel. Recent work involved addressing UI/UX enhancements, password delivery mechanisms, and improving the payment flow, as well as resolving initial routing issues. A major phase centered on integrating Moodle API endpoints and implementing a detailed video/module/question management system for courses, including seeding initial data. Subsequently, the focus shifted to building a complete student portal with profile management and a highly detailed, expanded administrative panel, progressively integrating all prior features into these new components. Challenges included Kubernetes environment limitations for , database model conflicts, and ensuring comprehensive backend and frontend testing. The work has progressed significantly towards a feature-rich application.

<product_requirements>
The goal is an EAD Moodle platform for Espírito Santo taxi drivers on Oracle Cloud, using Docker. Key features: PIX payment (CNPJ), study modules, and authentication (Auth0 migrating to Keycloak). UI: glassmorphism, taxi imagery. Registration requires: Placa, Alvará, Cidade, CPF, LGPD consent, leading to Asaas PIX. Includes an AI bot (TaxiBot), automated course liberation on payment, email/WhatsApp password delivery. Admin panel: user deletion, payment/region graphs, visual status, dynamic course pricing, course/video deletion, admin user management, password resets, and exam management. Student portal: payment status-driven module access, password reset, login popups, profile management (photo, contact, access history). New video management (YouTube links, modules, questions with 3 difficulty levels). Expanded Admin panel for EAD (Dashboard, Driver, Course, Assessment, Class, Reports, Institutional, Docs, Communication, Config, Integrations, Security). Final task: integrate all old admin features into the new EAD admin panel.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was in the process of a major refactor and feature consolidation for the administrative panel. The user had requested to integrate all functionalities from the *old*  into the *newly developed and expanded* .

To achieve this, the following actions were taken:
1.  **Analysis**: The  file was analyzed to identify existing features and their implementations (states, data fetching logic, functions, UI components within tabs like subscriptions, payments, courses, cities, admin users, and the recently added videos tab).
2.  ** Expansion**: The  component was significantly updated to incorporate:
    *   All relevant state variables (, , , , , , , , , , , , , ) from the old dashboard.
    *   The  function and other data fetching mechanisms (, , , , , ) to retrieve comprehensive administrative data.
    *   All associated utility and handler functions for managing subscriptions, users, payments, courses, cities, and admin users (e.g., , , , ).
3.  **New Tab Component **: A new component, , was created to hold and manage all the tabs of the now combined administrative panel. This component encapsulates the UI and logic for the general dashboard, driver management, course management, assessments, class management, reports, institutional management, communication, configurations, *and* all the tabs from the old  (like subscriptions, payments, courses, cities, and admin users, including the new video management tab).
4.  **Integration into **:  was integrated into , effectively making the  the central hub for all administrative functionalities, both old and new.

The last action performed was the integration of these complete tabs into the  component. The system has just restarted the frontend and backend supervisors to apply these changes.
