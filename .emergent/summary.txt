The AI engineer has progressively developed an EAD platform, iteratively building features and addressing user-reported bugs. Initial efforts established core components like user registration with extensive validation, PIX payments via Asaas, and an admin panel. Significant work focused on password management, including an eye icon for visibility, admin-initiated resets, and debugging email/WhatsApp delivery. The payment flow was refined to better manage user experience around Asaas redirects. The admin dashboard received major enhancements, adding dynamic course pricing, course management, city-based payment analytics, and administrative user controls. Recurring technical challenges involved MongoDB  serialization and persistent  failures during Asaas webhook processing. The project is currently at a stage where foundational features are largely implemented but require further refinement, particularly in payment synchronization and advanced authentication, with Moodle integration recently prioritized.

The overarching goal is to deliver a modern EAD Moodle platform for Espírito Santo taxi drivers on Oracle Cloud, using Docker. Key functionalities include PIX payment (CNPJ), study modules, and authentication (initially Auth0, migrating to Keycloak). The UI should feature glassmorphism and taxi-specific imagery. Registration requires Placa do Carro, Alvará, Cidade (with Outros option), CPF, and LGPD consent, leading directly to Asaas PIX payment. The platform needs an AI bot (TaxiBot), automated course liberation on payment, and email/WhatsApp password delivery. The admin panel must support user deletion, payment/region graphs, visual status indicators, dynamic course pricing, course deletion, and administrative user management with password resets. Student users need a portal with payment status-driven module access, student-initiated password reset, and informative login popups. Future Keycloak integration demands device restrictions (one mobile/one computer, unique name), login attempt blocking (5 attempts), and unique course certificates. The system also requires a field in the admin panel for student grades with a three-chance exam system. Moodle integration is currently the highest priority.

    -   **Changes**: Implemented API endpoints for AI chat, user subscriptions with extensive validation (name, email, CPF, , plate, LGPD), and handling . Added  for user deletion. The  was modified to process  events and use customer IDs, although persistent metadata storage issues remain. Password generation, development-mode email sending, and simulated WhatsApp functions were added. Authentication () was refined for the student portal. Course management endpoints () were introduced for dynamic pricing and deletion. Admin and student password reset functionalities (, ) and admin user management () were integrated. MongoDB  serialization in  was corrected.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component for routing, landing page, and user registration flow.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated  and . Registration form updated with , , , featuring geolocation and frontend validations. Implemented a password confirmation modal post-registration. Updated to fetch and display dynamic course pricing.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Admin panel for managing users, payments, courses, and administrative accounts.
    -   **Changes**: Added Excluir Usuário button. Introduced Gráficos tab for payment/region visualizations. Implemented Courses tab with dynamic course value display, edit price, and delete course functionalities. Added Cities tab with payment status graphs. A new Usuários Admin tab was created for administrative user creation, deletion, and password resets. Back to Portal button added to the admin login section.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Component handling the payment process.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to present payment options and a back button before redirecting to Asaas, addressing user flow and return path.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Student access portal.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected to use real backend authentication, with dynamic module access based on payment status. An eye icon was added for password visibility. Back to Portal button and popups for payment pending or incorrect password messages were implemented. A Forgot my password button with a reset modal was also added.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  is empty, indicating email is in development mode.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was responding to a user request to enhance UI/UX, re-verify password delivery, improve the payment flow, and add login popups.

Specifically, the following actions were taken:
-   **Back to Portal Buttons**: Successfully added back navigation buttons to both the student login () and admin login ().
-   **Password Delivery (Email/WhatsApp)**: Re-investigated the issue. It was confirmed that email sending is in development mode (logging email content instead of sending) due to an empty  in , and WhatsApp sending is explicitly simulated and not configured. This means the system provides transparent feedback about its current non-production state.
-   **Payment Flow Improvement**: Modified  to no longer automatically redirect to the Asaas sandbox. Instead, it now presents an intermediate screen with payment options, allowing for a back navigation and a better user experience for returning to the EAD portal.
-   **Login Popups**: Implemented popups in  to inform users about payment pending or incorrect password during login attempts.

Initial testing confirmed that the back buttons and popups were working, and the password delivery mechanism's status (simulated/failing) was clarified. However, a remaining issue was noted regarding the improved payment flow still needing attention, and there was an identified routing issue for  and  paths in the frontend. The user has since re-prioritized Moodle integration.
