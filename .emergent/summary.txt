The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack EAD platform, establishing core features like a modern UI with glassmorphism, PIX payment integration, and a subscription system. A comprehensive Terraform infrastructure on Oracle Cloud, integrating Moodle, Auth0, Docker, and CI/CD, was provisioned. Initially, a significant effort was spent resolving Git repository sync issues, confirming the  directory's presence. Subsequent work focused on implementing an AI bot (TaxiBot), refining the user registration and payment flow, and enhancing the admin dashboard. The AI bot encountered initial frontend issues, which were resolved through troubleshooting and re-implementation. The payment flow evolved from a standard form to a simplified direct PIX process with Asaas integration. Admin features like user deletion, payment/region graphs, and city fields were added, alongside visual status indicators. The current task involves refining support contact, fixing background image visibility, and integrating a new Asaas sandbox payment link with automated course liberation.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a modern EAD Moodle platform for taxi drivers in Espírito Santo, deployed on Oracle Cloud via Docker. Key features include PIX payment (CNPJ), EAD portal integration, study modules (CONTRAN Resolution 456/2013 + optional), Auth0 authentication (later requested Keycloak), an admin panel for user/payment management, 10-question exams, DETRAN-recognized certificates, and detailed contact info. Recent explicit requests expanded to include an AI bot (TaxiBot) for Q&A, password reset (email only now), and course information, along with automated course unlocking upon PIX payment. The UI/UX should be modern with glassmorphism, specific taxi imagery, and a historical watermark (Terceira Ponte). The registration form needs Placa do Carro, Alvará, and Cidade fields, with a unified Cadastro + Pagamento flow directly to PIX. Admin panel requires user deletion, payment/region graphs, and visual status indicators (paid/pending).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on integrating a new Asaas sandbox payment link () into the Finalizar com PIX flow. This involves updating the existing Asaas payment button in the  component. Concurrently, the engineer is also implementing the critical functionality to automatically liberate the course for the user once the payment through Asaas is successfully confirmed. This requires adding specific webhook endpoints in the  to receive payment notifications from Asaas and trigger the course unlocking logic. The trajectory ends with the AI engineer having updated the Asaas link in the frontend and added the necessary webhook endpoints in the backend, and is about to update the  component to utilize this new payment verification system. This work builds on the previous refinements of the registration and PIX payment flow, which now directs users directly to a payment page with an Asaas button and a manual PIX option, removing any hardcoded values and extraneous payment method selections.
