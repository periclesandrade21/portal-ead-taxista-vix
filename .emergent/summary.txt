The AI engineer has progressively built out a full-stack EAD platform, starting from core infrastructure and UI elements. The work trajectory shows a strong focus on iterative feature development based on user requests, addressing payments, user registration, and admin functionalities. Initial tasks involved refining the PIX payment flow to be direct via Asaas, including automated course liberation via webhooks. Subsequent efforts focused on enhancing the user registration experience by adding advanced validations for names, email, CPF, , and license plates, incorporating geolocation, and implementing LGPD compliance. A critical security bug in the student portal's authentication was fixed by integrating it with the backend. The most recent work centers on improving the reliability and user feedback for password delivery via email and WhatsApp, which currently uses a simulated WhatsApp and development-mode email.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to provide a modern EAD Moodle platform for Espírito Santo taxi drivers on Oracle Cloud, featuring Docker deployment, PIX payment (CNPJ), study modules, Auth0 (later Keycloak) authentication, and an admin panel. User requests expanded to include an AI bot (TaxiBot), email/WhatsApp password reset post-registration, and automated course liberation upon PIX payment. The UI needs glassmorphism and specific taxi imagery. Registration requires Placa do Carro, Alvará, Cidade (with Outros option), and CPF fields, flowing directly to Asaas PIX payment. Admin features include user deletion, payment/region graphs, and visual status indicators. Recent additions include robust validation for all registration fields, geolocation for city, and LGPD compliance. Password delivery needs to be secure and reliable.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user report concerning password delivery and notification. The user reported that the email for password delivery failed, and no WhatsApp message was received, despite the frontend popup indicating success for WhatsApp.

The engineer investigated  and identified two core issues:
1.  **Email Sending:** The email function  required SMTP configuration () which was not present, causing it to fail.
2.  **WhatsApp Sending:** The  function was explicitly simulated, meaning it never actually sent a message.

To address these, the engineer made the following changes in :
-   **Password Generation:** Improved the  function to create more secure and readable 10-character passwords (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
-   **Email Sending:** Modified  to use a development mode where email content is logged instead of actually sent, providing detailed insights into the email's structure and content without requiring SMTP credentials. This leverages  for a simplified email system.
-   **WhatsApp Sending:** The  function was kept as a simulation, with the acknowledgment that it needs a real API in production. The system is now transparently informing about its failure in the absence of an API configuration.

The backend was restarted, and preliminary tests confirmed that the improved password generation and development-mode email logging are functioning as expected. The WhatsApp function continues its simulated behavior. The next step is to verify these changes on the frontend popup to ensure the user receives accurate status feedback.
