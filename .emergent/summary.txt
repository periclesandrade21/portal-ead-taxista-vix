The AI engineer's work spanned several major feature developments and continuous refinements. Initially, core EAD platform features like user registration, PIX payments, and an admin panel were established. This evolved into deep integration with Moodle for course/video/question management and the creation of comprehensive student and administrative portals. Significant effort was dedicated to migrating and consolidating existing functionalities into new, expanded components, particularly for the Admin EAD dashboard. Recent iterations addressed crucial user feedback, including implementing advanced reporting, refining a multi-step registration process, improving password management with WhatsApp/email integration, and enhancing the mobile user experience. The process involved extensive frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) modifications, alongside debugging UI rendering and state management issues. The current state reflects a feature-rich application, with the immediate focus on further administrative panel enhancements and text adjustments for the registration flow.

The objective is to build an EAD Moodle platform for Espírito Santo taxi drivers on Oracle Cloud using Docker. Key functionalities include PIX payment, study modules, and authentication (migrating from Auth0 to Keycloak). The UI should feature glassmorphism and taxi imagery. Registration requires placa, alvará, cidade, CPF, LGPD consent, leading to Asaas PIX. The platform includes an AI bot (TaxiBot), automated course liberation on payment, and email/WhatsApp password delivery. The Admin panel needs user deletion, payment/region graphs, visual status, dynamic course pricing, course/video deletion, admin user management, password resets, exam management, and eventually 9 types of detailed reports with filters and export options. The Student portal requires payment status-driven module access, password reset, login popups, profile management (photo, contact, access history). A new video management system (YouTube, modules, questions with 3 difficulty levels) was added. The Admin EAD dashboard was expanded to include 12 features (Dashboard, Driver, Course, Assessment, Class, Reports, Institutional, Docs, Communication, Config, Integrations, Security), with all old admin features consolidated into this new panel. User feedback later refined the Admin EAD to include discounts/donations, student password reset, clearing fields, and a dedicated tab for student documents/data. A new multi-step registration (7 steps: Personal, Address/Contact, Professional, Document Upload, Terms, Payment, AI Validation) with specific document formats/sizes and an improved payment flow was requested. Mobile UI issues (menu visibility, button styling, Admin EAD positioning) were reported. Enhanced password sending via WhatsApp/email, real-time registration visibility in Admin EAD, precise AI document validation, and renaming Cadastro Profissional Completo to Faça seu cadastro were also requested.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's latest feedback regarding the multi-step registration and the Admin EAD. The current work involved:

1.  **Improving Admin EAD for Documents and Student Data**: A new Documents tab was created within  and integrated into . This tab is intended to allow consultation of student documents and detailed data.
2.  **Modifying Multi-Step Registration**:
    *   The DocumentValidationStep (IA validation step) was removed from the  component, reducing the total steps.
    *   The  was modified to redirect to the *old* payment system.
    *   The renaming of Cadastro Profissional Completo to Faça seu cadastro was initiated, with the explicit goal of including the text Fazer Inscrição Completa within this section. This indicates the engineer was in the process of finalizing text and structural adjustments related to the main registration entry point in the frontend.

The system is currently in a state where these modifications are being applied and integrated, with the last action focusing on text changes for the registration section.
